# Surfshark Alert API Demo
This demo project's purpose is to demonstrate the bare minimum required to check a password against known breaches. **This is not a production ready code!**

## Demo project structure
* `/server` folder contains an example implementation of a local server, which is configured to serve the breached password checking demo page and acts as a local rate limiting proxy to Surfshark Alert API.
* `/client` folder contains an example of the breached password checking demo web page implementation.
